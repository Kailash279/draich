While the guideline includes CM example s for different modalities, it cannot always provide detailed explanations or address specific implementation aspects to illustrate how Qould be applied to the broad range of products under its scope. The CM experience across different regions is curre ntly limited and varied. During the development of the guideline, external and internal stakeholders and interested parties clearly communicated the novelty and complexity of the concepts described in the Quideline. The constituent reviews and feedback received during the public consultation period illustrated the varied levels of understanding of key concepts and implementation aspects by the stakeholders. Notably, implementation of Qithin the pharmaceutical quality management system and lifecycle management of CM were areas of variable interpretation or lack of understanding. Industry and regulatory organizations in many regions will need to take additional steps to implement the Qoncepts, including staff training, ideally before Qmplementa tion in each region .

Risk Assessment Risk assessment consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis and evaluation of risks associated with exposure to those hazards (as defined below).

Typical sources of uncertainty include gaps in knowledge, gaps in pharmaceutical science and process understanding, sources of harm (e.g., failure modes of a process, sources of variability), and probability of detection of problems.",
                    "The output of a risk assessment is either a quantitative estimate of risk or a qualitative description of a range of risk. When risk is expressed quantitatively, a numerical probability is used. Alternatively, risk can be expressed using qualitative descriptors, such as “high”, “medium”, or “low”, which should be defined in as much detail as possible. Sometimes a \"risk score\" is used to further define descriptors in risk ranking. In quantitative risk assessments, a risk estimate provides the likelihood of a specific consequence, given a set of riskgenerating circumstances. Thus, quantitative risk estimation is useful for one particular consequence at a time. Alternatively, some risk management tools use a relative risk measure to combine multiple levels of severity and probability into an overall estimate of relative risk. The intermediate steps within a scoring process can sometimes employ quantitative risk estimation.",

INTRODUCTION Risk management principles are effectively utilized in many areas of business and government including finance, insurance, occupational safety, public health, pharmacovigilance, and by agencies regulating these industries. In the pharmaceutical sector, the principles and framework of ICH Q, coupled with the official ICH training material that supports this guideline, are instrumental in enhancing the application of effective quality risk management by industry and regulators. The importance of quality systems has been recognized in the pharmaceutical industry and it is evident that quality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality system.",
                    "It is commonly understood that risk is defined as the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. However, achieving a shared understanding of the application of risk management among diverse stakeholders is difficult because each stakeholder might perceive different potential harms, place a different probability on each harm occurring and attribute different severities to each harm. In addition, subjectivity can directly impact the effectiveness of risk management activities and the decisions made. Therefore, it is important that subjectivity is managed and minimized. In relation to pharmaceuticals, although there are a variety of stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners as well as government and industry, the protection of the patient is of prime importance when managing the risk to product quality and availability, when availability risks arise from quality/manufacturing issues.",
                    "The manufacturing and use of a drug (medicinal) product, including its components, necessarily entail some degree of risk. The risk to its quality is just one component of the overall risk. It is important to understand that product quality is assured based on appropriate risk based decisionmaking throughout the product lifecycle, such that the attributes that are important to the quality of the drug (medicinal) product are maintained and the product remains safe and effective.",
                    "An effective quality risk management approach can further ensure the quality of the drug (medicinal) product to the patient by providing a proactive means to identify and control potential quality issues during development, manufacturing, and distribution. This includes an appropriate application of root cause analysis that can identify and address the root cause(s) and other causal factors (e.g., humanrelated) of such issues. A proactive approach to quality risk management is beneficial, as it facilitates robust product design and continual improvement, and it is of strategic importance in achieving an effective pharmaceutical quality system. (See ICH Qor guidance in relation to an effective pharmaceutical quality system.) Additionally, use of quality risk management can improve the decisionmaking if a quality problem arises.",
                    "In the development phase and as part of validation, quality risk management is part of building knowledge and understanding risk scenarios, so that appropriate risk control can be decided upon for use during the commercial manufacturing phase. In this context, knowledge is used to make informed riskbased decisions, trigger reevaluations and stimulate continual improvements. Effective and proactive quality risk management can enable better, more informed and timely decisions throughout the lifecycle. This can provide regulators with greater assurance of a company’s ability to deal with potential risks and avert problems, and can beneficially affect the extent and level of direct regulatory oversight.",

                    "In a traditional approach to developing a manufacturing process and control strategy, set points and operating ranges are typi cally set narrowly based on the observed data to ensure consistency of manufacture . More emphasis is placed on assessment of CQAs at the stage of the drug substance (i.e., end product testing) . The traditional approach provides limited flexibility in the operating ranges to address variability (e.g., in raw materials).",
                    "An enhanced approach to manufacturing process development generates better process and product understanding than the traditional approach, so sources of variability can be identified in a more systematic way . This allows for the development of more meaningful and efficient parametric, attribute, and procedural controls . The control strategy might be developed through several iterations as the level of process understanding increases duri ng the product lifecycle . A control strategy based on an enhanced approach can provide for flexibility in the operating ranges for process Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances (Chemical Entities and Biotechnological/Biological Entities) arameters to address variability (e.g., in raw materials) .",

For example, with sterilised chemical entities or biotechnological/biological drug substances, there is an inherent limitation in the ability to detect low levels of bacterial or viral contamination . In these cases, testing on the drug substance is considered to provide inadequate assurance of quality, so additional control s (e.g., attribute and in process controls) are incorporated into the control strategy.",

The physical properties of a drug substance are determined during the final crystallisation step and subsequent operations (e.g., milling, micronising), all of which occur at the end of the manufacturing process . Impurities introduced or created early in the manufact uring process typically have more opportunities to be removed in purification operations (e.g., washing, crystallisation of isolated intermediates) than impurities generated late in the manufacturing process, and are therefore less likely to be carried int o the drug substance . However, in some cases (e.g., when peptides or oligonucleotides are synthesised on a solid support), there is a more limited relationship between risk and number of steps from the end of the manufacturing process;  Regulatory authori ties assess whether the controls on the drug substance and drug substance manufacturing process can be considered adequate, including whether there are appropriate controls for impurities . To conduct this assessment, enough of the drug substance manufactu ring process should be described in the application for regulatory authorities to understand how impurities are formed in the process, how changes in the process could affect the formation, fate, and purge of impurities, and why the proposed control strate gy is suitable for the drug substance manufacturing process .

These concepts of formal and informal risk management conflict with the guidance on formality that is included in ICH Q, which states that f ormality in QRM is not a binary concept ( i.e., formal/informal); it states that formality can be considered to be a continuum (or spectrum), ranging from low to high.",
